# Electric Vehicles Data Analysis (INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD USING EXEL AND TABLEU)

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) data to extract insights regarding EV adoption trends, vehicle types, manufacturers, and state-wise distributions. The dataset contains information on battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), their model years, range, and manufacturer details.Dataset Details

- ## EV Adoption Trends
 ## Total EVs: 150,413
This indicates a growing number of electric vehicles in use.
Average Electric Range: 67.83 miles
The average range suggests that EVs are still primarily suited for short to medium commutes.
## Total Battery EVs (BEVs): 116,745 (77.6% of all EVs)
A majority of EVs are fully electric, showing a shift towards BEVs over plug-in hybrids.
## Total Plug-in Hybrid EVs (PHEVs): 33,668 (22.4% of all EVs)
PHEVs are still relevant but represent a smaller share.

# Steps Taken

## 1. Data Collection

The dataset was obtained from publicly available sources and contains information on EVs by state, make, and eligibility.

## 2. Data Cleaning

- Removed duplicate entries.

- Standardized manufacturer names.

- Filtered dataset to include only relevant vehicle types.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed the distribution of vehicles by model year.

- Visualized EV adoption trends using bar charts and line graphs.

- Identified top EV manufacturers and their market share.

## 4. Data Visualization

- Used Microsoft Excel and Tableau to create visual representations of the data.

- Generated a heatmap for state-wise EV distribution.

- Created pie charts for manufacturer-wise vehicle distribution.

- Developed dashboards in Tableau for interactive data exploration.

## How to Set Up the Project

- Download the dataset and ensure it is formatted correctly in Excel.

- Open Tableau and import the dataset.

-  Use Tableau features to create visualizations:

- Bar charts for vehicle trends by model year.

- Pie charts for manufacturer distribution.

- Heatmaps for state-wise EV adoption.

- Customize the dashboard layout and filters for better insights.

# Findings from the Analysis

## EV Adoption Over Time
The Vehicles by Model Year graph shows a significant increase in EV adoption, peaking in 2023 with 37.1K vehicles.
Early years (2011-2016) had minimal adoption, but a sharp increase began after 2017.
The drop in 2024 might be due to incomplete data collection for that year.
## Geographic Distribution
Washington (WA) has the highest EV count (150,082).
Other states have significantly fewer EVs, suggesting that incentives, policies, and charging infrastructure vary across regions.
## Market Share by Manufacturer
Tesla dominates with 54.10% (68,939 EVs).
Nissan (13,497) and Chevrolet (12,024) follow but with significantly smaller shares.
Other manufacturers such as Ford, BMW, Kia, Volkswagen, Hyundai, and Audi have relatively lower shares, indicating Tesla’s strong market presence.
## Top EV Models
Tesla Model Y (28,501 - 28.15%) and Model 3 (27,708 - 27.37%) are the most popular EVs.
Nissan Leaf (13,187 - 13.03%) is the only non-Tesla vehicle in the top three.
Tesla’s Model S, Model X, and Chevrolet’s Bolt EV also show strong presence.
## Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility
41.81% of EVs are eligible for CAFV incentives, meaning they meet the required environmental and efficiency standards.
11.85% are ineligible, which could be due to outdated models or non-compliance with CAFV standards.
46.34% have unknown eligibility status, which may indicate missing data.

## Recommendations for Stakeholders
Expand Charging Infrastructure

Given the increasing adoption rate, policymakers should invest in more charging stations, especially in lower-adoption states.
Incentivize BEVs Over PHEVs

Since BEVs already make up 77.6% of EVs, further incentives can accelerate full EV adoption.
Encourage Competition Beyond Tesla

Tesla holds over 54% market share. Other manufacturers should increase production capacity and offer competitive models.
Enhance CAFV Awareness & Policies

With 46.34% of vehicles having unknown eligibility, authorities should streamline eligibility criteria and improve public awareness.
Monitor 2024 Adoption Trends

The sharp drop in 2024 should be analyzed to determine if it's due to reporting delays or actual market slowdowns.
Final Thoughts
This dashboard highlights the rapid growth of EV adoption, Tesla’s dominance, and the need for more infrastructure. Future improvements could include predictive modeling to forecast adoption trends and deeper analysis into state-wise adoption barriers.


###  Average Electric Range is 195 Miles

The average range for EVs in the dataset is 195 miles.

While this is sufficient for most urban commutes, longer trips may still require charging stops.

The need for improved battery efficiency and charging infrastructure is evident.

###  State-wise EV Adoption Varies

Some states have a high concentration of EVs, while others lag behind.

This could be due to differences in government policies, charging infrastructure, and consumer awareness.

States with higher EV adoption likely offer incentives and have better charging networks.

## Recommendations to Stakeholders

### 1. For Policymakers & Government Agencies

Expand Charging Infrastructure: More fast-charging stations should be built, particularly in states with lower adoption.

Increase Incentives: Higher rebates and tax benefits can encourage more people to switch to EVs.

Support Battery Technology Advancements: Investing in research can lead to improved battery performance and lower costs.

Mandate Stricter Emission Regulations: Encouraging EV adoption through policies can help reduce carbon emissions.

### 2. For Automobile Manufacturers

Develop More Affordable EVs: Lowering the price of EVs can make them accessible to a wider audience.

Improve Battery Range: Investing in better battery technology can help overcome range anxiety.

Expand Service and Charging Networks: Partnering with charging station providers can enhance customer convenience.

Promote EV Awareness: More consumer education on the benefits of EVs can drive higher adoption rates.

### 3. For Energy & Charging Companies

Increase Fast-Charging Stations: More public charging points will make EV adoption easier.

Develop Renewable Energy-Powered Charging: Using solar or wind energy can make EV charging more sustainable.

Collaborate with the Government: Joint efforts can lead to better infrastructure planning.

### 4. For Consumers & Businesses

Adopt EV Fleets: Businesses can reduce operational costs by switching to electric fleets.

Consider Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): EVs have lower running costs compared to gas-powered vehicles.

Use Government Incentives: Taking advantage of tax benefits can make EV purchases more affordable.
