# Electric Vehicles Data Analysis (INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD USING EXEL AND TABLEU)

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) data to extract insights regarding EV adoption trends, vehicle types, manufacturers, and state-wise distributions. The dataset contains information on battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), their model years, range, and manufacturer details.Dataset Details

Total Vehicles: 47,039

Vehicle Types: BEV, PHEV

Top Manufacturers: Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, Kia, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Ford

CAFV Eligibility: 100% eligible vehicles

Average Electric Range: 195.0 miles

# Steps Taken

## 1. Data Collection

The dataset was obtained from publicly available sources and contains information on EVs by state, make, and eligibility.

## 2. Data Cleaning

Removed duplicate entries.

Standardized manufacturer names.

Filtered dataset to include only relevant vehicle types.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed the distribution of vehicles by model year.

Visualized EV adoption trends using bar charts and line graphs.

Identified top EV manufacturers and their market share.

## 4. Data Visualization

Used Microsoft Excel and Tableau to create visual representations of the data.

Generated a heatmap for state-wise EV distribution.

Created pie charts for manufacturer-wise vehicle distribution.

Developed dashboards in Tableau for interactive data exploration.

## How to Set Up the Project

Download the dataset and ensure it is formatted correctly in Excel.

Open Tableau and import the dataset.

Use Tableau features to create visualizations:

Bar charts for vehicle trends by model year.

Pie charts for manufacturer distribution.

Heatmaps for state-wise EV adoption.

Customize the dashboard layout and filters for better insights.

Conclusion

This project provides insights into EV adoption patterns, helping policymakers and businesses understand market trends. Future improvements can include integrating more datasets and advanced analytics.
