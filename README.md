# Electric Vehicles Data Analysis (INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD USING EXEL AND TABLEU)

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) data to extract insights regarding EV adoption trends, vehicle types, manufacturers, and state-wise distributions. The dataset contains information on battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), their model years, range, and manufacturer details.Dataset Details

-Total Vehicles: 47,039

-Vehicle Types: BEV, PHEV

- Top Manufacturers:
- Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, Kia, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Ford

- CAFV Eligibility: 100% eligible vehicles

- Average Electric Range: 195.0 miles

# Steps Taken

## 1. Data Collection

The dataset was obtained from publicly available sources and contains information on EVs by state, make, and eligibility.

## 2. Data Cleaning

- Removed duplicate entries.

- Standardized manufacturer names.

- Filtered dataset to include only relevant vehicle types.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed the distribution of vehicles by model year.

- Visualized EV adoption trends using bar charts and line graphs.

- Identified top EV manufacturers and their market share.

## 4. Data Visualization

- Used Microsoft Excel and Tableau to create visual representations of the data.

- Generated a heatmap for state-wise EV distribution.

- Created pie charts for manufacturer-wise vehicle distribution.

- Developed dashboards in Tableau for interactive data exploration.

## How to Set Up the Project

- Download the dataset and ensure it is formatted correctly in Excel.

- Open Tableau and import the dataset.

-  Use Tableau features to create visualizations:

- Bar charts for vehicle trends by model year.

- Pie charts for manufacturer distribution.

- Heatmaps for state-wise EV adoption.

- Customize the dashboard layout and filters for better insights.

# Findings from the Analysis

 ### 1. Tesla Dominates the Market

Tesla accounts for 57.34% of all EVs, making it the most dominant brand.

The Model 3 is the most popular EV, followed by the Model S and Model X.

This suggests that Tesla’s strong brand presence, innovation, and extensive charging infrastructure contribute to its market dominance.

### 2. Nissan and Chevrolet are Strong Competitors

Nissan’s LEAF is the second most popular EV, making up 24.40% of total EVs.

Chevrolet’s Bolt EV follows, accounting for 8.78% of the total.

These brands offer lower-cost alternatives to Tesla, making EVs more accessible to a broader audience.

### 3. Rising EV Adoption Over Time

EV adoption has been increasing significantly since 2016.

Policies, tax incentives, and improvements in battery technology have likely influenced this trend.

The sharp rise in EV numbers suggests growing consumer confidence in electric vehicles.

### 4. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are More Popular Than Plug-in Hybrids (PHEVs)

The dataset contains 100% BEVs, with 0% PHEVs.

This suggests a consumer preference for fully electric vehicles over hybrid options.

The declining presence of PHEVs may indicate a shift toward fully electric mobility solutions.

### 5. Average Electric Range is 195 Miles

The average range for EVs in the dataset is 195 miles.

While this is sufficient for most urban commutes, longer trips may still require charging stops.

The need for improved battery efficiency and charging infrastructure is evident.

### 6. State-wise EV Adoption Varies

Some states have a high concentration of EVs, while others lag behind.

This could be due to differences in government policies, charging infrastructure, and consumer awareness.

States with higher EV adoption likely offer incentives and have better charging networks.

## Recommendations to Stakeholders

### 1. For Policymakers & Government Agencies

Expand Charging Infrastructure: More fast-charging stations should be built, particularly in states with lower adoption.

Increase Incentives: Higher rebates and tax benefits can encourage more people to switch to EVs.

Support Battery Technology Advancements: Investing in research can lead to improved battery performance and lower costs.

Mandate Stricter Emission Regulations: Encouraging EV adoption through policies can help reduce carbon emissions.

### 2. For Automobile Manufacturers

Develop More Affordable EVs: Lowering the price of EVs can make them accessible to a wider audience.

Improve Battery Range: Investing in better battery technology can help overcome range anxiety.

Expand Service and Charging Networks: Partnering with charging station providers can enhance customer convenience.

Promote EV Awareness: More consumer education on the benefits of EVs can drive higher adoption rates.

### 3. For Energy & Charging Companies

Increase Fast-Charging Stations: More public charging points will make EV adoption easier.

Develop Renewable Energy-Powered Charging: Using solar or wind energy can make EV charging more sustainable.

Collaborate with the Government: Joint efforts can lead to better infrastructure planning.

### 4. For Consumers & Businesses

Adopt EV Fleets: Businesses can reduce operational costs by switching to electric fleets.

Consider Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): EVs have lower running costs compared to gas-powered vehicles.

Use Government Incentives: Taking advantage of tax benefits can make EV purchases more affordable.
